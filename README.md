# Phatom Tokens
This module is mainly intended for use in combination with other modules such as [Token Attacher](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-attacher/), [Item Piles](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles), or other modules that allow the creation of tokens which you might not want to accidentally move or see all the time.

The module adds a ghost toggle button to the token layer controls on the top right. This button allows to to toggle the phantom layer. When the layer is active you can change the pahntom mode of a token via its HUD, while it is inactive the mode gets applied. YOu can cycle through the modes via left or right click. You can change the mode of multiple tokens by selecting them and using the mode button on one of them.
The following modes are available:
- anchored: The token can not be dragged
- unclickable: The token can not be interacted with
- phantom: The token is invisible

### Languages:
